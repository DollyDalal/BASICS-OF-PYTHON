## 📘 Theory (Basic Explanation)

### 1. Variables

Variables are used to store data values.
Example: `x = 10`

### 2. Data Types

Common data types in Python:

* int (Integer)
* float (Decimal numbers)
* str (String / text)
* bool (True/False)

### 3. Conditional Statements

Used to make decisions in a program.
Example: if, elif, else

### 4. Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code.

* for loop
* while loop

### 5. Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code.
They help in reducing repetition and improving readability.
